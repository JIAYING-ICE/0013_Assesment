    "#### **Question 1: Is Airbnb 'out of control' in London?**\n",
    "Brief: We want to define what is out of Control and our assumption about it. In London, for example, of the 81,000 Airbnb properties available, more than 50,000 are entire properties, meaning at least one in every 74 homes in the UK capital is available for short-term let. (Minton, 2023). We wish to locate the Airbnb first, then assess its density by zone or borough. Based on that, evaluate the number of houses and apartments relative to the number of Airbnb listings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sub-Questions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is our Control (define it, the filter we are applying to entire homes and apartments)?\\\n",
    "   *We are defining out of Control as the number of Airbnb short-term rentals according to location compared to the number of houses/rentals in that area. Also, to evaluate the difference in revenue between these two.*\n",
    "2. Where are the Airbnb locations in London according to Area (MSOA)? (density of Airbnb) \n",
    "3. catograzing Airbnb has more than 90-day rentals> if the apartment's primary function is Airbnb.\n",
    "4. How many Council/regular houses vs Airbnb houses per Area (MSOA)?\n",
    "5. Optional: Can we evaluate the price in revenue and compare each category?\\\n",
    "   *Rental Price: Compare the rent of Airbnb vs council/regular houses to see the difference? (OUTOFCONTROL?)*\n",

    "#### **Question 2: How many professional landlords are there?**\n",
    "Brief: We want to define what a Professional Landlord is by determining whether they own more than one listing and whether their primary income comes from Airbnb revenue, as we believe these are the defining characteristics. We plan to do this by evaluating the number of days the listing is rented throughout the year, possibly using the listing description from 2023, and analyzing reviews as a proxy to estimate how often the listing is rented each month. Using this, we will calculate the average monthly rent and the annual revenue.\n",
